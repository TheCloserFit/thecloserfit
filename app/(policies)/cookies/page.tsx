      <p>
        This document informs Users about the technologies that help this
        Application to achieve the purposes described below. Such technologies
        allow the Owner to access and store information (for example by using a
        Cookie) or use resources (for example by running a script) on a User’s
        device as they interact with this Application. For simplicity, all such
        technologies are defined as "Trackers" within this document – unless
        there is a reason to differentiate. For example, while Cookies can be
        used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be inaccurate to talk
        about Cookies in the context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based
        Tracker. For this reason, within this document, the term Cookies is only
        used where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type of
        Tracker. Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also
        require the User's consent. Whenever consent is given, it can be freely
        withdrawn at any time following the instructions provided in this
        document. This Application uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner
        (so-called “first-party” Trackers) and Trackers that enable services
        provided by a third-party (so-called “third-party” Trackers). Unless
        otherwise specified within this document, third-party providers may
        access the Trackers managed by them. The validity and expiration periods
        of Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary depending on the lifetime
        set by the Owner or the relevant provider. Some of them expire upon
        termination of the User’s browsing session. In addition to what’s
        specified in the descriptions within each of the categories below, Users
        may find more precise and updated information regarding lifetime
        specification as well as any other relevant information — such as the
        presence of other Trackers — in the linked privacy policies of the
        respective third-party providers or by contacting the Owner.

          How to manage preferences and provide or withdraw consent on this
          Application
        </strong>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Whenever the use of Trackers is based on consent, users can provide or
        withdraw such consent by setting or updating their preferences via the
        relevant privacy choices panel available on this Application. With
        regard to any third-party Trackers, Users can manage their preferences
        via the related opt-out link (where provided), by using the means
        indicated in the third party's privacy policy, or by contacting the
        third party.

          How to control or delete Cookies and similar technologies via your
          device settings
        </strong>
      </h4>
      <p>Users may use their own browser settings to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          See what Cookies or other similar technologies have been set on the
          device;
        </li>
        <li>Block Cookies or similar technologies;</li>
        <li>Clear Cookies or similar technologies from the browser.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The browser settings, however, do not allow granular control of consent
        by category. Users can, for example, find information about how to
        manage Cookies in the most commonly used browsers at the following

        Users may also manage certain categories of Trackers used on mobile apps
        by opting out through relevant device settings such as the device
        advertising settings for mobile devices, or tracking settings in general
        (Users may open the device settings and look for the relevant setting).

      <h4>
        <strong>Consequences of denying the use of Trackers</strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        Users are free to decide whether or not to allow the use of Trackers.
        However, please note that Trackers help this Application to provide a
        better experience and advanced functionalities to Users (in line with
        the purposes outlined in this document). Therefore, if the User chooses
        to block the use of Trackers, the Owner may be unable to provide related
        features.

        information on the use of such technologies by this Application.
