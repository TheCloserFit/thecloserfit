        platform: GitHub Username, and all the data connected to the GitHub
        authentication (if the users connect via GitHub), the extracted text
        from the uploaded resume, (the particular data here depends on the
        content of the resume that the user uploads (it can vary from users to

        The User assumes responsibility for the personal data of third parties

      <h3>Methods of Data Processing</h3>
      <h4>Processing Methods</h4>
      <p>
        The Data Controller adopts appropriate security measures to prevent
        unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or destruction of
        Personal Data. Processing is carried out through IT and/or telematic
        tools, including automated ones, with organizational methods and logic
        strictly related to the stated purposes. In addition to the Data
        Controller, in some cases, other individuals involved in the
        organization of this platform (such as administrative, sales, marketing
        personnel, legal advisors, system administrators) or external parties
        (such as third-party technical service providers, hosting providers, IT
        companies, communication agencies) may have access to the Data, acting
        as Data Processors if necessary, as appointed by the Data Controller.
        The updated list of Data Processors can always be requested from the
        Data Controller.
      </p>

      <h3>Legal Basis for Processing</h3>
      <p>
        The Data Controller processes the user's personal data if one of the
        following conditions applies:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The user has given consent for one or more specific purposes related
          to the processing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Processing is necessary for the execution of a contract with the user
          or to implement pre-contractual measures.
        </li>
        <li>
          Processing is required to fulfill a legal obligation to which the Data
          Controller is subject.
        </li>
        <li>
          Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in
          the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in
          the Data Controller.
        </li>
        <li>
          Processing is necessary for the legitimate interests pursued by the
          Data Controller.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        It is always possible to request clarification from the Data Controller
        about the specific legal basis for each type of processing and whether
        the processing is based on legal requirements, contract provisions, or
        necessary to conclude a contract.
      </p>
      <h2>Location of Data Processing</h2>
      <p>
        Data is processed at the operational offices of the Data Controller and
        in any other location where the parties involved in the processing are
        located. For further information, contact the Data Controller.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user's Personal Data may be transferred to a country different from
        the one where the user is located. To obtain further information about
        the location of data processing, users can refer to the section
        detailing the processing of Personal Data. The user has the right to
        obtain information about the legal basis for transferring data outside
        the European Union or to an international organization governed by
        public international law or constituted by two or more countries, as
        well as about the security measures adopted by the Data Controller to
        protect the Data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user can verify whether any of these transfers take place by
        reviewing the relevant section of this document or by requesting
        information from the Data Controller using the contact details provided.
      </p>

      <h2>Retention Period</h2>
      <p>
        Data is processed and stored for as long as necessary for the purposes
        for which it was collected. Specifically:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Personal Data collected for purposes related to the execution of a
          contract between the Data Controller and the user will be retained
          until the contract is fully executed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Personal Data collected for purposes related to the legitimate
          interest of the Data Controller will be retained until such interest
          is fulfilled. The user can obtain further information regarding the
          legitimate interest pursued by the Data Controller in the relevant
          sections of this document or by contacting the Data Controller.
        </li>
        <li>
          When processing is based on the user's consent, the Data Controller
          may retain Personal Data for a longer period until such consent is
          revoked. Additionally, the Data Controller may be obligated to retain
          Personal Data for a longer period in compliance with a legal
          obligation or by order of an authority.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        At the end of the retention period, Personal Data will be deleted.
        Therefore, after the expiration of this period, the right to access,
        delete, rectify, and the right to data portability can no longer be
        exercised. Practically, data is retained until users choose to delete
        their data. Users can delete their account at any time through the
        platform, which will also remove all associated data from our system.
      </p>

      <h2>Purposes of Data Processing</h2>
      <p>
        The user's data is collected to allow the Data Controller to provide the
        service, comply with legal obligations, respond to requests or enforce
        actions, protect its own rights and interests (or those of users or
        third parties), identify any fraudulent or malicious activities, and for
        the following purposes: contacting the user, registration and
        authentication on this platform, managing support requests, hosting and
        backend infrastructure, transferring data outside the EU, collecting
        privacy preferences, managing user databases, registration and

      <h2>Data Transfer Within and Outside the EU</h2>
      <p>
        The Data Controller may transfer Personal Data collected within the EU
        to third countries (i.e., all countries outside the EU) only in
        compliance with a specific legal basis. Therefore, such Data transfers
        are carried out based on one of the legal grounds described below. Users
        may request information from the Data Controller regarding the specific
        legal basis applicable to each service.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Transfer to Countries Ensuring European Standards</h2>
      <p>
        When this is the legal basis, the transfer of Personal Data from the EU
        to third countries occurs based on an adequacy decision adopted by the
        European Commission. The European Commission adopts adequacy decisions
        with respect to specific third countries that it considers to provide a
        level of protection for Personal Data comparable to that of European
        legislation. Users can view the updated list of adequacy decisions on
        the European Commission’s website.

      <p>
        This type of service allows the platform to manage support and contact
        requests received via email or other communication tools. The Personal
        Data processed depends on the information provided by the user in their
        messages and the tool used for communication (such as an email address).
      </p>
      <h2>Hosting and Backend Infrastructure</h2>
      <p>
        This type of service is designed to host data and files that allow this
        website to function, enabling distribution and providing a ready-to-use
        infrastructure to deliver specific functionalities of this website.

        personal information, as required by applicable privacy legislation.
      </p>

      <h2>User Database Management</h2>
      <p>
        This type of service enables the Data Controller to create user profiles
        starting from an email address, name, or any other information provided
        by the user on this platform, as well as to track user activities

        with publicly available information about the user (such as social
        network profiles) and used to create private profiles that the Data
        Controller can view and use to improve this platform.
