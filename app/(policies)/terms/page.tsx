      <h2>Conditions for Account Registration</h2>

        Registration of User accounts on this Application is subject to the
        conditions outlined below. By registering, Users agree to meet such
        conditions.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Accounts registered by bots or any other automated methods are not
          permitted.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unless explicitly permitted, a User account may not be shared with
          other persons.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Account Termination</h2>
      <p>
        Users can terminate their account and stop using the Service at any time
        by doing the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          By directly contacting the Owner at the contact details provided in
          this document or via the platform.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Account Suspension and Deletion</h2>
      <p>
        The Owner reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to suspend or
        delete at any time and without notice, User accounts that it deems
        inappropriate, offensive, or in violation of these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The suspension or deletion of User accounts shall not entitle Users to
        any claims for compensation, damages, or reimbursement. The suspension
        or deletion of accounts due to causes attributable to the User does not
        exempt the User from paying any applicable fees or prices.
      </p>

      <h2>User and Visitor Obligations</h2>
      <p>
        Below, we list a series of obligations and promises that each user or
        visitor must respect to use this platform and access our services.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Services cannot be used by individuals under the age of 16.</li>
        <li>
          To use the Services, you agree to the following:
          <ol>
            <li>You must be of “Minimum Age” or older.</li>
            <li>
              You must have only one account on the platform, which must be in
              your real name.
            </li>
            <li>
              Creating an account with false information constitutes a violation
              of our terms and conditions, including accounts registered on
              behalf of third parties or individuals under 16 years of age.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        “Minimum Age” means 16 years. However, if the law requires you to be
        older for The Closer Fit to legally provide the Services to you without
        parental consent (including using your personal data), then the Minimum
        Age is as defined by law.
      </p>

      <h2>User and Visitor Rights</h2>
      <p>
        At any time, you may request the information you provided during
        registration, as well as download or modify that information, as
        specified in our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You and The Closer Fit agree that we may access, store, process, and use
        all the information and personal data you provide in accordance with the
        terms and conditions of the Privacy Policy and your choices (including
        settings).
      </p>
      <p>
        By submitting suggestions or other feedback, you agree that The Closer
        Fit may use and share such feedback for any purpose without compensating
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        You agree to provide only content or information that does not violate
        the law or third-party rights. The Closer Fit may be required by law to
        remove certain information or content in some countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may change, suspend, or discontinue any of our Services. The Closer
        Fit reserves the right to limit your use of the Services, including your
        number of connections and ability to contact other users.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can delete your account at any time, thus ending the relationship
        between you and The Closer Fit. Even after deletion, The Closer Fit
        reserves the right to retain the information you have freely provided us
        for the time necessary for data processing.
      </p>
      <h2>General Terms</h2>
      <p>
        If any provision of these Terms is deemed unenforceable or invalid, that
        provision will be modified and interpreted to achieve the objectives of
        that provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and
        the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding the applicable law, we believe it is fair to choose the law of
        the user's country of habitual residence if they reside within the
        European Union.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless otherwise specified here, the failure to exercise a right or
        demand compliance with an obligation under these Terms will not affect a
        party's ability to exercise such right or demand compliance at any later
        time, nor will the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any
        subsequent breach.
      </p>
      <p>
        These terms and conditions are provided in Italian but can be translated
        into multiple languages through the platform's functionality. In case of
        disputes, the interpretation of the document in Italian will prevail.
      </p>

      <h3>Common Provisions</h3>
      <h4>No Waiver</h4>
      <p>
        The Owner’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms
        shall not constitute a waiver of any such right or provision. No waiver
        shall be considered a further or continuing waiver of such term or any
        other term.
      </p>

      <h4>Service Interruption</h4>
      <p>
        To ensure the best possible service level, the Owner reserves the right
        to interrupt the Service for maintenance, system updates, or any other
        changes, informing the Users appropriately.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within the limits of law, the Owner may also decide to suspend or
        discontinue the Service altogether. If the Service is discontinued, the
        Owner will cooperate with Users to enable them to withdraw personal data
        or information and will respect Users' rights relating to continued
        product use and/or compensation, as provided for by applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, the Service might not be available due to reasons outside
        the Owner’s reasonable control, such as “force majeure” events
        (infrastructural breakdowns or blackouts).
      </p>

      <h4>Service Reselling</h4>
      <p>
        Users may not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any

        express prior written permission.
      </p>

      <h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
      <p>
        To learn more about the use of their personal data, Users may refer to
        the privacy policy of this Application.
      </p>

      <h4>Intellectual Property Rights</h4>
      <p>
        Without prejudice to any more specific provision of these Terms, any
        intellectual property rights, such as copyrights, trademark rights,
        patent rights, and design rights related to this Application are the
        exclusive property of the Owner or its licensors.
      </p>
      <p>
        All trademarks, trade names, service marks, word marks, illustrations,
        images, or logos appearing in connection with this Application are, and

      </p>

      <h4>Changes to these Terms</h4>
      <p>
        The Owner reserves the right to amend or otherwise modify these Terms at
        any time. In such cases, the Owner will appropriately inform the User of
        these changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such changes will only affect the relationship with the User from the
        date communicated to Users onwards. The continued use of the Service
        will signify the User’s acceptance of the revised Terms. If Users do not
        wish to be bound by the changes, they must stop using the Service and
        may terminate the Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The User can obtain any previous version of the Terms from the Owner if
        required.
      </p>
      <h2>Assignment of Contract</h2>
      <p>
        The Owner reserves the right to transfer, assign, dispose of by
        novation, or subcontract any or all rights or obligations under these
        Terms, taking the User’s legitimate interests into account. Provisions
        regarding changes of these Terms will apply accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users may not assign or transfer their rights or obligations under these
        Terms in any way, without the written permission of the Owner.
      </p>

      <h2>Severability</h2>
      <p>
        Should any provision of these Terms be deemed or become invalid or
        unenforceable under applicable law, the invalidity or unenforceability
        of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining
        provisions, which shall remain in full force and effect.
      </p>

      <h3>US Users</h3>
      <p>
        Any such invalid or unenforceable provision will be interpreted,
        construed, and reformed to the extent reasonably required to render it
        valid, enforceable, and consistent with its original intent. These Terms
        constitute the entire Agreement between Users and the Owner with respect
        to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all other communications,
        including but not limited to all prior agreements, between the parties
        with respect to such subject matter. These Terms will be enforced to the
        fullest extent permitted by law.
      </p>

      <h3>EU Users</h3>
      <p>
        Should any provision of these Terms be or be deemed void, invalid, or
        unenforceable, the parties shall do their best to find, in an amicable
        way, an agreement on valid and enforceable provisions thereby
        substituting the void, invalid or unenforceable parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        In case of failure to do so, the void, invalid, or unenforceable
        provisions shall be replaced by the applicable statutory provisions, if
        so permitted or stated under the applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without prejudice to the above, the nullity, invalidity or impossibility
        to enforce a particular provision of these Terms shall not nullify the
        entire Agreement, unless the severed provisions are essential to the
        Agreement, or of such importance that the parties would not have entered
        into the contract if they had known that the provision would not be
        valid, or in cases where the remaining provisions would translate into
        an unacceptable hardship on any of the parties.
      </p>

      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the law of the place where the Owner is

      <p>
        However, regardless of the above, if the law of the country where the

        standards, such higher standards shall prevail.

      </p>

      <h2>Venue of Jurisdiction</h2>
      <p>
        The exclusive competence to decide on any controversy resulting from or
        connected to these Terms lies with the courts of the place where the
        Owner is based, as displayed in the relevant section of this document.
      </p>

      <h3>Exception for Consumers in Europe</h3>
      <p>
        The above does not apply to any Users that qualify as European

        Norway, or Iceland.
      </p>
