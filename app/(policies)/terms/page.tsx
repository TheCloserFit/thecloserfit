        By using the Service, you agree to comply with and be legally bound by
        the terms and conditions outlined here and in our Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        You also acknowledge that failure to comply with these terms may result
        in the suspension or termination of your access to the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>Modification of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        The Owner reserves the right to modify these terms at any time. Any such
        changes will take effect when posted on the platform. It is your
        responsibility to review the updated terms periodically.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Protection</h2>
      <p>
        We are committed to safeguarding your personal data. You can learn more
        about how we collect, use, and store your data in our Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <h2>Termination</h2>
      <p>
        The Owner reserves the right to terminate your access to the Service at
        any time for breach of these terms or for any reason that may compromise
        the security or integrity of the platform.
      </p>

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        The platform and all associated services are provided "as is," with no
        express or implied warranties. You agree that use of the platform is at
        your sole risk.
      </p>

      <h2>Limitations of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        The Owner shall not be held responsible for any indirect, incidental, or
        consequential damages arising from your use of the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>Governing Law</h2>
      <p>
        These terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the
        Owner is based.
      </p>

      <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        Any disputes arising from these terms will be settled in accordance with
        the applicable laws in the jurisdiction of the Owner's location.
      </p>

      <h2>The Closer Fit Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        The Closer Fit and its affiliates will not be liable to you for any
        amount exceeding (A) the total fees you paid or are payable to The
        Closer Fit for the services during the term of this agreement, or (B)
        €100.
      </p>
      <p>
        The limitation of liability applies to all claims of liability (e.g.,
        warranty, tort, negligence, contract, and law), even if The Closer Fit
        or its affiliates were aware of the possibility of such damages.
      </p>
      <p>
        These limitations do not apply to liability for death or personal
        injury, fraud, gross negligence, or intentional misconduct, or in cases
        of negligence involving the breach of a material obligation.
      </p>

      <h2>General Terms</h2>
      <p>
        If any provision of these Terms is deemed unenforceable or invalid, that
        provision will be modified to achieve its objectives as much as possible
        under applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
        We choose the law of the user’s country of habitual residence if they
        reside within the European Union.
      </p>
      <p>
        Failure to exercise a right or demand compliance will not affect a
        party’s ability to do so later. The waiver of a breach does not
        constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.
      </p>
      <p>
        These terms are provided in Italian but can be translated. In case of
        disputes, the Italian version prevails.
      </p>

      <h2>Liability Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        The Owner, its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents,
        partners, suppliers, and employees will not be liable for indirect,
        punitive, incidental, or exemplary damages, including loss of profits,
        goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses.
      </p>
      <p>
        This applies even if the User has been advised of the possibility of
        such damages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of damages,
        so these limitations may not apply.
      </p>

      <h2>Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        The User agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Owner and
        its affiliates, officers, directors, agents, partners, suppliers, and
        employees from and against any claims, damages, or expenses arising
        from:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>User's use of the Service</li>
        <li>User’s violation of these terms</li>
        <li>User’s violation of any third-party rights</li>

      <h2>Common Provisions</h2>
      <h3>No Waiver</h3>
      <p>

        The Owner reserves the right to interrupt the Service for maintenance,
        system updates, or other changes, informing Users appropriately.

      </p>

      <h3>Governing Law</h3>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the law of the place where the Owner is
        based. However, higher consumer protection standards from the User’s
        location may prevail.
      </p>

      <h3>Accessibility</h3>
      <p>
        The Owner is committed to making the content accessible to Users with
        disabilities. If Users encounter accessibility issues, they should
